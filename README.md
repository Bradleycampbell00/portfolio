# portfolio

This is a website to showcase my portfolio, and introduce myself to potential employers. I have also included a way for you to contact me in a seperate webpage.

Started out by making the contact.html, index.html, and portfolio html.

modified a navbar from bootstrap to move the links all the way to the right and have them go to the webpage.

created the index webpage and use that as my base for the rest of the webpages.

then i created a css page to add more styles than just the bootstrap had.+
